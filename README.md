## Detailed Project Descriptions

- <a href="https://github.com/danteojong-it/Basic-Log-Monitoring-and-Analysis-/tree/main">Log Monitoring and Analysis SIEM with Splunk </a>                 
• Installed and configured Splunk Enterprise on Windows 11 to collect and centralize system event logs (Application, Security, System).
• Utilized Windows Event Viewer to manage and clear event logs during controlled testing and log ingestion phases.
• Developed and refined Search Processing Language (SPL) queries to analyze large volumes of log data, increasing query performance and detection accuracy by an
estimated 43%.
• Created custom Splunk dashboards to visualize key security events, enhancing visibility and response speed by roughly 35%.
• Practiced detecting simulated critical security incidents such as unauthorized privileged access and audit log clearance through continuous log monitoring.
• Gained hands-on experience in SIEM configuration, log analysis, and incident detection, enhancing practical cybersecurity monitoring skills.

- **Ethical Hacking & Network Security Lab**   
• Designed and built a virtual cybersecurity lab using VirtualBox, simulating real-world attack and defense scenarios with a 100% success rate in identifying and
exploiting vulnerabilities.
• Utilized Kali Linux tools to execute penetration testing and vulnerability scanning against Metasploitable2.
• Improved hands-on skills in ethical hacking techniques, including reconnaissance, exploitation, and post-exploitation.
• Gained experience configuring isolated virtual environments to safely test and analyze network security risks.

- **PC Assembly, OS Installation, and Hardware Troubleshooting**   
• Built and assembled 10+ custom gaming and personal PCs from components, ensuring optimal hardware compatibility and performance.
• Installed and configured operating systems including Windows, troubleshooting installation issues and driver conflicts.
• Diagnosed and resolved hardware issues related to CPU, SSD, RAM, GPU, and peripherals, reducing setup time and improving system stability.
