## Project Highlights

- <a href="https://github.com/danteojong-it/Basic-Log-Monitoring-and-Analysis-/tree/main">Log Monitoring and Analysis SIEM with Splunk </a>                 
In this project, I installed and configured Splunk Enterprise on a Windows desktop operating system to collect local system event logs. Specifically, I ingested key Windows event logs: Application, Security, and System logs. These logs provide foundational information on system operations, security events, and application behavior, which are critical for monitoring system health and security.

- **Personal Virtual Lab for Ethical Hacking and Network Security Simulation**   
Designed and maintained a virtual cybersecurity lab using VirtualBox, simulating Windows and Linux environments. Practiced ethical hacking, vulnerability scanning, and network segmentation using tools like Wireshark, Nmap, Metasploit, and Active Directory.

- **Cybersecurity-Focused IT Support & Networking Project**   
Delivered hands-on troubleshooting across Windows, macOS, and Linux systems. Built custom PCs, configured BIOS/UEFI settings, and resolved hardware/software issues. Used Cisco Packet Tracer for VLAN, DHCP, and CLI-based router/switch configuration. Conducted traffic analysis and enforced security controls.
